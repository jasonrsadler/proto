To setup and run (tested on Ubuntu 16.04 x64):

1. Install .NET Core following the instructions 
for your version of linux at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x

2. Download and install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download

3. Open VS Code and go to ->File->Open Folder and open the folder that contains the source

4. Click Program.cs. VS Code will prompt you to install the C# plugin. 
After finished click 'Reload' on the extensions menu.

--Additional setup will occur in the VS Code console. wait until this finishes.

Once the VS Code console says 'Done', close VS Code and reopen (you may get a 
prompt that extensions were modified. Click 'Reload' on this)

Ensure that the VS Code console is open with ->View->Integrated console
and make sure you are in the same directory as the source.

Press F5 to run the program. The program will write to stdout on 
the VS Code console.
(You might get a preLaunchTask failed 'build' on the first run. 
Click 'Debug Anyway' to run the program)
